        <b>Spotter</b>- Have someone spot you while you work. Just ask a friend, sibling, relative, or someone else you trust can be thoroughly obnoxious, to check in with you and make sure you get back to work if you get off task.
        <br><br>
        <b>Self Control</b>- If you know you're the kind of person who gets easily distracted, work in a quiet place where you know no one will interrupt you. Don't try to multitask, and make sure to set your phone aside. Temporarily deactivate your social networking accounts if that's what it takes! It's all about control.
        <br><br>
        <b>Delayed Gratification</b>- If you know an assignment will take a long time, or would be painful to complete in one sitting, start as early as possible! Just think how good it'll feel when the assignment's deadline is right around the corner but you have nothing to worry about; after you're done, you can just sit back, relax, and spend time doing something you love!
        <br><br>
        <b>Tick Tock</b>- <a href="#organiser">Time yourself!</a> Whenever you start an assignment, set a goal time for yourself and focus on finishing your task within that time frame. You can even keep a log of how much time it took you to finish your various tasks and compete with yourself to beat your times!
        <br><br>
        <b>Habit Tracker</b>- Create a journal to keep track of your habits. Write down what your bad habits are, how you can battle them, and most importantly, write down what's been helping you get rid of them or work more efficiently.
